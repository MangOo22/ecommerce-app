# Ecommerce Backend App

# Introduction

  Welcome to our ecommerce API! This document will guide you through the process of integrating with our API, including information on available endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication.

# Ecommerce API

  This API provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating, managing, and querying data about an online store. It includes endpoints for creating and managing users, categories, subcategories, brands, products, reviews, wishlists, addresses, coupons, carts, and orders.

## Getting Started

  To get started with the API, you will need to first create an account. Once you have created an account, you will be able to generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate all requests to the API.


# Tools

-   `Node.js`: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building scalable network applications.
-   `Express.js`: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and web applications.
-   `MongoDB`: A NoSQL database used for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
-   `Mongoose`: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to model application data and interact with the database.
-   `Render`: A cloud platform for deploying and scaling web applications, providing simplicity and scalability.
-   `Stripe`: A payment gateway used to facilitate secure online payments between customers and Admin.
-   `Multer`: A middleware used to handle file uploads in Node.js applications, used to upload images and files to the server.
-   `Nodemailer`: A module used to send emails from the application to users for account verification, order confirmation, and other events.
-   `Winston`: A logging library used to log application behavior and performance to track errors and debug issues.
-   `Morgan`: An HTTP request logger middleware used to log HTTP requests and responses for debugging and monitoring.


## Core Features

- `User Authentication`: Authenticates users using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- `Product Management`: Allows Admin to create, update, and delete products.
- `Product Listing`: Displays products with details such as name, price, description, and images.
- `Shopping Cart`: Enables customers to add products to a cart, view the cart, and proceed to checkout.
- `Order Management`: Allows Admin to manage orders, view order details, and update order status.
- `Payment Gateway Integration`: Integrates with Stripe for secure online payments between customers and Admin.
- `User Profile`: Allows users to manage their profiles, update personal information, and view order history.
- `Search and Filter`: Enables customers to search for products based on keywords, categories, and other criteria.
- `Product Reviews`: Allows customers to leave reviews and ratings for products.
- `Order Tracking`: Enables customers to track the status of their orders.

## Additional Features

- `Email Notifications`: Sends automated email notifications to users for account verification, order confirmation, and other events.
- `Logging and Monitoring`: Includes logging functionality using Winston and Morgan to track application behavior and performance.
- `Error Handling`: Implements error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages to users.
- `API Documentation`: Provides comprehensive documentation for APIs using tools like Swagger to facilitate code maintenance and collaboration.
- `Code Version Control`: Utilizes version control systems such as Git to track code changes.
- `Environment Configuration`: Utilizes environment variables to manage configuration settings and sensitive information, ensuring security and flexibility.

# Architecture 

The backend follows a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture, Express.js, and MongoDB. The architecture is designed to ensure code reusability, separation of concerns, and scalability to accommodate future growth and changes in the application's requirements.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The backend architecture of `ecommerce` follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which divides the application into three main components:

-   `Models`: Represents the data structure of the application, interacts with the database using Mongoose, and defines the schema for each resource.
-   `Controllers`: Processes incoming requests, interacts with services, and returns responses to clients.
-   `Routes`: Defines the API endpoints, maps HTTP methods to controller actions, and provides a standardized interface for clients to interact with the application.

## Database Schema

The database used for `ecommerce` is MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.

The database schema for `ecommerce` consists of the following collections:

-   `Users`: Stores user information such as name, email, password, and order history.
-   `Products`: Stores product information such as name, price, description, images, and seller details.
-   `Orders`: Stores order information such as customer details, product details, order status, and payment details.
-   `Reviews`: Stores review information such as product ID, customer ID, rating, comment, and timestamps.
-   `Carts`: Stores cart information such as user ID, product ID, quantity, and total cart price.
-   `Categories`: Stores category information such as name, description, and subcategories.
-   `Subcategories`: Stores subcategory information such as name, description, and parent category.
-   `Brands`: Stores brand information such as name, description, and products.
-   `Coupons`: Stores coupon information such as name, expiration date, discount amount, and usage limit.


## RESTful API Design 

The API design for `ecommerce` follows RESTful principles, with clear and predictable URL structures, HTTP methods, and status codes. The API endpoints are organized into resource-based routes, with each route corresponding to a specific resource or entity in the system. The API design includes the following key features:


-   `Resource-Based Routes`: Organizes API endpoints into resource-based routes such as /users, /products, and /orders.
-   `CRUD Operations`: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all resources using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
-   `Pagination and Filtering`: Supports pagination and filtering for listing resources.
-   `Search and Sorting`: Allows users to search for resources based on keywords, categories, and other criteria, enhancing resource discovery.
-   `Error Handling`: Provides informative error messages, status codes, and error responses to help clients understand and handle errors effectively.

## Modular Structure

-   **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests, process data, and send responses to clients.
-   **Models**: Define data structures and schemas for MongoDB collections using Mongoose.
-   **Routes**: Define API endpoints, route requests to controllers, and handle HTTP methods.
-   **Middleware**: Implement custom middleware functions for authentication, validation, error handling, etc.
-   **Exceptions**: Define custom exception classes to handle errors and exceptions in the application.
-   **Utils**: Contain utility functions, helper classes, and third-party integrations to assist with common tasks.
-   **DB**: Contain data access objects to interact with the MongoDB database.

## Error Handling

The backend architecture of `ecommerce` includes a robust error handling mechanism to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages, status codes, and error responses to clients. The error handling mechanism includes the following key features:

-   `Custom Exceptions`: Defines custom exception classes to handle errors and exceptions in the application, providing detailed error messages and status codes.
-   `Error Middleware`: Implements error middleware functions to catch and handle exceptions, log errors, and send error responses to clients.
-   `Global Error Handling`: Centralizes error handling logic in a global error handler middleware to ensure consistent error responses across the application.
-   `Error Logging`: Logs errors and exceptions to track application behavior, monitor performance, and debug issues effectively.
-   `Error Response Format`: Standardizes error responses with a consistent format, including status codes, error messages, error details, and stack traces.
